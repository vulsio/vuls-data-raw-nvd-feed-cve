				{
					"lang": "en",
					"value": "A vulnerability in the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol implementation of Cisco&nbsp;AsyncOS software for Cisco&nbsp;Email Security Appliance (ESA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause high CPU usage on an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\nThe vulnerability is due to inefficient processing of incoming TLS traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of crafted TLS packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a prolonged state of high CPU utilization. The affected device would still be operative, but response time and overall performance may be degraded.There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability."
