					"value": "An issue was discovered in savignano S/Notify before 4.0.2 for Jira. While an administrative user is logged on, the configuration settings of S/Notify can be modified via a CSRF attack. The injection could be initiated by the administrator clicking a malicious link in an email or by visiting a malicious website. If executed while an administrator is logged on to Jira, an attacker could exploit this to modify the configuration of the S/Notify app on that host. This can, in particular, lead to email notifications being no longer encrypted when they should be."
