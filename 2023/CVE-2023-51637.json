This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Sante PACS Server PG. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the implementation of the DICOM service, which listens on TCP port 11122 by default.
