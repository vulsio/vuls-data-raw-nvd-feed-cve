					"value": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of a small subset of Cisco IP Phones could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of an affected interface to view a page containing malicious HTML or script content. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid credentials to access the web-based management interface of the affected device."
