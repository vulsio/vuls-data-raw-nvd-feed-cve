					"lang": "en",
					"value": "For migration as well as to work around kernels unaware of L1TF (see\nXSA-273), PV guests may be run in shadow paging mode.  Since Xen itself\nneeds to be mapped when PV guests run, Xen and shadowed PV guests run\ndirectly the respective shadow page tables.  For 64-bit PV guests this\nmeans running on the shadow of the guest root page table.\n\nIn the course of dealing with shortage of memory in the shadow pool\nassociated with a domain, shadows of page tables may be torn down.  This\ntearing down may include the shadow root page table that the CPU in\nquestion is presently running on.  While a precaution exists to\nsupposedly prevent the tearing down of the underlying live page table,\nthe time window covered by that precaution isn't large enough.\n"
