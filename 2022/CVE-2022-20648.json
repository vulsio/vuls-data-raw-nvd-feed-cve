					"value": "A vulnerability in a debug function for Cisco&nbsp;RCM for Cisco&nbsp;StarOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform debug actions that could result in the disclosure of confidential information that should be restricted.\r\nThis vulnerability exists because of a debug service that incorrectly listens to and accepts incoming connections. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the debug port and executing debug commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view sensitive debugging information.Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability."
