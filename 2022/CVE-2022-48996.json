In the case, DAMON sysfs interface is supposed to\nupdate, remove, or add schemes to reflect the sysfs files.  However, the\ncode is assuming the DAMON context wouldn't have schemes at all, and\ntherefore creates and adds new schemes.  As a result, the code doesn't\nwork as intended for online schemes tuning and could have more than\nexpected memory footprint.  The schemes are all in the DAMON context, so\nit doesn't leak the memory, though.\n\nRemove the wrong asssumption (the DAMON context wouldn't have schemes) in\n'damon_sysfs_set_schemes()' to fix the bug."
