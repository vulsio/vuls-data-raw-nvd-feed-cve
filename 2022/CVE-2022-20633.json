An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending authentication requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to confirm existing user accounts, which could be used in further attacks.\r\nCisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability."
