Reason: this candidate was intended for one issue in Samba, but it was used for multiple distinct issues, including one in FUSE and one in ncpfs.  Notes: All CVE users should consult CVE-2010-0787 (Samba), CVE-2010-0788 (ncpfs), and CVE-2010-0789 (FUSE) to determine which ID is appropriate.  All references and descriptions in this candidate have been removed to prevent accidental usage"
