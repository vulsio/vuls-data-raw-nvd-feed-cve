					"lang": "en",
					"value": "A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) feature of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause an unexpected reload of the device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of SNMP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SNMP request to an affected device using IPv4 or IPv6. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability affects all versions of SNMP (versions 1, 2c, and 3) and requires a valid SNMP community string or valid SNMPv3 user credentials."
