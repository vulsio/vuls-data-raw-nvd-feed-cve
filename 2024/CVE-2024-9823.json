					"value": "Description\nThere exists a security vulnerability in Jetty's DosFilter which can be exploited by unauthorized\n\nusers to cause remote denial-of-service (DoS) attack on the server using DosFilter. By repeatedly sending crafted requests,\n\nattackers can trigger OutofMemory errors and exhaust the server's memory finally.\n\n\nVulnerability details\nThe Jetty DoSFilter (Denial of Service Filter) is a security filter designed to protect web\n\napplications against certain types of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and other abusive behavior. It\n\nhelps to mitigate excessive resource consumption by limiting the rate at which clients can make\n\nrequests to the server.  The DoSFilter monitors and tracks client request patterns, including\n\nrequest rates, and can take actions such as blocking or delaying requests from clients that exceed\n\npredefined thresholds.  The internal tracking of requests in DoSFilter is the source of this OutOfMemory\n\ncondition.\n\n\nImpact\nUsers of the DoSFilter may be subject to DoS attacks that \nwill ultimately exhaust the memory of the server if they have not \nconfigured session passivation or an aggressive session inactivation \ntimeout.\n\n\nPatches\nThe DoSFilter has been patched in all active releases to no longer support the session tracking mode, even if configured.\n\n\nPatched releases:\n\n\n\n  *  9.4.54\n\n  *  10.0.18\n\n  *  11.0.18\n\n  *  12.0.3"
