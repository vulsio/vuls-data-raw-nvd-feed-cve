A possible XSS vulnerability with certain configurations of Rails::HTML::Sanitizer may allow an attacker to inject content if HTML5 sanitization is enabled and the application developer has overridden the sanitizer's allowed tags where the \"math\", \"mtext\", \"table\", and \"style\" elements are allowed and either either \"mglyph\" or \"malignmark\" are allowed. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.6.1."
