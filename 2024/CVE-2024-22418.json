It allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code by embedding it within a file's name. For instance, using a filename such as “><img src=x onerror=prompt('XSS')>.jpg” triggers the vulnerability. When this file is uploaded, the JavaScript code within the filename is executed. This issue has been addressed in version 6.8.29. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
