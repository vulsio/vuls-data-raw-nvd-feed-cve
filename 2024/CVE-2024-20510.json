					"lang": "en",
					"value": "A vulnerability in the Central Web Authentication (CWA) feature of Cisco IOS XE Software for Wireless Controllers could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to bypass the pre-authentication access control list (ACL), which could allow access to network resources before user authentication.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to a logic error when activating the pre-authentication ACL that is received from the authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) server. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to a wireless network that is configured for CWA and sending traffic through an affected device that should be denied by the configured ACL before user authentication. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured ACL protections on the affected device before the user authentication is completed, allowing the attacker to access trusted networks that the device might be protecting."
