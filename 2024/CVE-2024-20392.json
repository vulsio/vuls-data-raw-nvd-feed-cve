					"value": "A vulnerability in the web-based management API of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Secure Email Gateway could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct an HTTP response splitting attack. \r\n\r This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of some parameters that are passed to the web-based management API of the affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of an affected interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, resulting in the execution of arbitrary script code in the browser of the targeted user, or could allow the attacker to access sensitive, browser-based information."
