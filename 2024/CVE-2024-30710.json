					"value": "An issue was discovered in ROS2 Dashing Diademata in ROS_VERSION 2 and ROS_PYTHON_VERSION 3, where the system transmits messages in plaintext. This flaw exposes sensitive information, making it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks, and allowing attackers to easily intercept and access this data. NOTE: this is disputed by multiple third parties who believe there was not reasonable evidence to determine the existence of a vulnerability."
