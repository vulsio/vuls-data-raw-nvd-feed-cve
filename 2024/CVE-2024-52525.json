The session data is encrypted before being saved in the session storage (Redis or disk), but it would allow a malicious process that gains access to the memory of the PHP process, to get access to the cleartext password of the user. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 28.0.12, 29.0.9 or 30.0.2."
