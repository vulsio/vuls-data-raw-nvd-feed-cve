					"value": "** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability in Apache Aurora.\n\nAn endpoint exposing internals to unauthenticated users can be used as a \"padding oracle\" allowing an anonymous attacker to construct a valid authentication cookie. Potentially this could be combined with vulnerabilities in other components to achieve remote code execution.\n\nAs this project is retired, we do not plan to release a version that fixes this issue. Users are recommended to find an alternative or restrict access to the instance to trusted users.\n\nNOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.\n\n"
