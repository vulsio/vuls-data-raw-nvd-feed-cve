					"value": "The Page Restriction WordPress (WP) â€“ Protect WP Pages/Post plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to information disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.4. This is due to the plugin not properly restricting access to pages via the REST API when a page has been made private. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to view protected pages. The vendor has decided that they will not implement REST API protection on posts and pages and the restrictions will only apply to the front-end of the site. The vendors solution was to add notices throughout the dashboard and recommends installing the WordPress REST API Authentication plugin for REST API coverage."
