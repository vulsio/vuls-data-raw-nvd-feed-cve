				{
					"lang": "en",
					"value": "There is a MEDIUM severity vulnerability affecting CPython.\n\nThe\n “socket” module provides a pure-Python fallback to the \nsocket.socketpair() function for platforms that don’t support AF_UNIX, \nsuch as Windows. This pure-Python implementation uses AF_INET or \nAF_INET6 to create a local connected pair of sockets. The connection \nbetween the two sockets was not verified before passing the two sockets \nback to the user, which leaves the server socket vulnerable to a \nconnection race from a malicious local peer.\n\nPlatforms that support AF_UNIX such as Linux and macOS are not affected by this vulnerability. Versions prior to CPython 3.5 are not affected due to the vulnerable API not being included."
