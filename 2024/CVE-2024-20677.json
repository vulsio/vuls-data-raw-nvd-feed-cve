This includes Office 2019, Office 2021, Office LTSC for Mac 2021, and Microsoft 365.</p>\n<p>3D models in Office documents that were previously inserted from a FBX file will continue to work as expected unless the Link to File option was chosen at insert time.</p>\n<p>This change is effective as of the January 9, 2024 security update.</p>\n"
