					"lang": "en",
					"value": "The /n software IPWorks SSH library SFTPServer component can be induced to make unintended filesystem or network path requests when loading a SSH public key or certificate. To be exploitable, an application calling the SFTPServer component must grant user access without verifying the SSH public key or certificate (which would most likely be a separate vulnerability in the calling application).Â IPWorks SSH versions 22.0.8945 and 24.0.8945 were released to address this condition by blocking all filesystem and network path requests for SSH public keys or certificates."
