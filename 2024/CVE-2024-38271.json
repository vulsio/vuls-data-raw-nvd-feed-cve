					"value": "There exists a vulnerability in Quickshare/Nearby where an attacker can force the a victim to stay connected to a temporary hotspot created for the share. As part of the sequence of packets in a QuickShare connection over Bluetooth, the attacker forces the victim to connect to the attacker’s WiFi network and then sends an OfflineFrame that crashes Quick Share.\nThis makes the Wifi connection to the attacker’s network last instead of returning to the old network when the Quick Share session is done allowing the attacker to be a MiTM. We recommend upgrading to version 1.0.1724.0 of Quickshare or above"
