If a malicious user can access the worker node which has kubean's deployment, he/she can abuse these excessive permissions to do whatever he/she likes to the whole cluster, resulting in a cluster-level privilege escalation. This issue has been addressed in release version 0.18.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
