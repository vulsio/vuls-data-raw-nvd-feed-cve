					"value": "Ampache is a web based audio/video streaming application and file manager. The current implementation of token parsing fails to properly validate CSRF tokens when activating or deactivating plugins. This vulnerability allows an attacker to exploit CSRF attacks, potentially enabling them to change website features that should only be managed by administrators through malicious requests. This issue has been addressed in version 7.0.1 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
