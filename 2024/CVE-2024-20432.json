					"lang": "en",
					"value": "A vulnerability in the REST API and web UI of Cisco Nexus Dashboard Fabric Controller (NDFC) could allow an authenticated, low-privileged, remote attacker to perform a command injection attack against an affected device.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper user authorization and insufficient validation of command arguments. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting crafted commands to an affected REST API endpoint or through the web UI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the CLI of a Cisco NDFC-managed device with network-admin privileges.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nNote: This vulnerability does not affect Cisco NDFC when it is configured for storage area network (SAN) controller deployment."
