					"value": "Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane. Starting in version 1.14.0 and prior to versions 1.14.16 and 1.15.10, a policy rule denying a prefix that is broader than `/32` may be ignored if there is a policy rule referencing a more narrow prefix (`CIDRSet` or `toFQDN`) and this narrower policy rule specifies either `enableDefaultDeny: false` or `- toEntities: all`. Note that a rule specifying `toEntities: world` or `toEntities: 0.0.0.0/0` is insufficient, it must be to entity `all`.This issue has been patched in Cilium v1.14.16 and v1.15.10. As this issue only affects policies using `enableDefaultDeny: false` or that set `toEntities` to `all`, some workarounds are available. For users with policies using `enableDefaultDeny: false`, remove this configuration option and explicitly define any allow rules required. For users with egress policies that explicitly specify `toEntities: all`, use `toEntities: world`."
