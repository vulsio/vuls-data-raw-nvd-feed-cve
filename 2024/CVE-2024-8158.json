					"value": "A bug in the 9p authentication implementation within lib9p allows an attacker with an existing valid user within the configured auth server to impersonate any other valid filesystem user.\n\nThis is due to lib9p not properly verifying that the uname given in the Tauth and Tattach 9p messages matches the client UID returned from the factotum authentication handshake.\n\n\nThe only filesystem making use of these functions within the base 9front systems is the experimental hjfs disk filesystem, other disk filesystems (cwfs and gefs) are not affected by this bug.\n\nThis bug was inherited from Plan 9 and is present in all versions of 9front and is remedied fully in commit 9645ae07eb66a59015e3e118d0024790c37400da."
