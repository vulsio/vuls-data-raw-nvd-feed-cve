					"value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npowerpc/kasan: Limit KASAN thread size increase to 32KB\n\nKASAN is seen to increase stack usage, to the point that it was reported\nto lead to stack overflow on some 32-bit machines (see link).\n\nTo avoid overflows the stack size was doubled for KASAN builds in\ncommit 3e8635fb2e07 (\"powerpc/kasan: Force thread size increase with\nKASAN\").\n\nHowever with a 32KB stack size to begin with, the doubling leads to a\n64KB stack, which causes build errors:\n  arch/powerpc/kernel/switch.S:249: Error: operand out of range (0x000000000000fe50 is not between 0xffffffffffff8000 and 0x0000000000007fff)\n\nAlthough the asm could be reworked, in practice a 32KB stack seems\nsufficient even for KASAN builds - the additional usage seems to be in\nthe 2-3KB range for a 64-bit KASAN build.\n\nSo only increase the stack for KASAN if the stack size is < 32KB."
