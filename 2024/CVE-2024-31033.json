					"value": "JJWT (aka Java JWT) through 0.12.5 ignores certain characters and thus a user might falsely conclude that they have a strong key. The impacted code is the setSigningKey() method within the DefaultJwtParser class and the signWith() method within the DefaultJwtBuilder class. NOTE: the vendor disputes this because the \"ignores\" behavior cannot occur (in any version) unless there is a user error in how JJWT is used, and because the version that was actually tested must have been more than six years out of date."
